# Basic-Components-of-a-Web-Layout

Hi! Welcome to this beginner-friendly **Frontend Engineering** challenge for [Hactoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). A project focused on people getting started with frontend development.

Everyone is encouraged to participate, regardless of your skill level (If you don't have the required skills, use this project as a motivation to learn those!). This is a practice project and should be considered a playground.

## About the Project:

You've to basically make components which are used often in a website. For eg. Navbar, Sidebar, Alert box, Carousel, Pagination etc.

You'll definitely learn a lot from this project. This project will be divided into to parts:

1. Basic HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
2. ReactJS

Make sure the code must be unique and valid otherwise it will not be accepted.

## Guidelines

Please try to follow these guidelines:

- [ ] Use only CSS/SCSS or Styled Components for styling the app, DON'T use bootstrap, material UI, semantic UI or any other styling library. (Haha! :wink: No shortcuts here :rofl:)

- [ ] Try to make the UI as elegant as possible, use Cards, box-shadows etc. Choose a subtle color-theme.

- [ ] Prefer functional components over class components, use react hooks.

- [ ] Unless absolutely necessary, don't use Redux for state management, try keeping things simple!

- [ ] Only use images/content that are available for free and don't need any special license.

- [ ] Last but not the least, use your imagination to build the coolest app you can think of ! :heart_eyes_cat: :fire: :fire:
